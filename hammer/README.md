End-to-end Application
======================

ETL-recommendation Pipeline
----------------------------

Hammer is an end-to-end application to simulate the offline ETL-recommendation pipeline workload which daily occurs in a retailer's Data Warehouse. Basically it consists of four steps:

1.	ETL: update the Data Warehouse with daily collected structural sales records and textual Apache logs

2.	Pref: calculate the user-item preferences regarding both sales history and Apache logs

3.	Sim: use the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm in mahout-0.7 to calculate the item-item similarity matrix which can be used for real-time recommendation

4.	Test: offline validate the item-item similarity matrix

The base Hammer data (i.e., sales table and related dimensional tables) are generated by TPC-DS toolkit, and the extended Apache logs are created by our random generator based on the sales data.
